/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for a blog-style website.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model for managing blog posts, authors, tags, and site-wide configurations.
 * Admins, identified by their presence in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection, have broad access to create, update, and delete content.
 * Read access to blog posts, authors, tags, and site configurations is generally public.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /blogPosts/{blogPostId}: Stores individual blog posts, with each document containing an `authorId` field to link it to an author.
 * - /authors/{authorId}: Stores author profiles.
 * - /tags/{tagId}: Stores blog post tags.
 * - /siteConfiguration/{configId}: Stores site-wide configuration settings. Only one document is expected (configId = 'siteConfig').
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: A collection to store UIDs of admin users. The existence of a document for a user grants admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: Read access is generally open to facilitate content consumption.
 * - Admin-Only Writes: Write access for blog posts, authors, tags, and site configurations is restricted to admins.
 * - No User Listing: Listing users is not supported; access to author profiles is by ID only.
 * - Site Configuration: There should be only one site configuration document; ID should be 'siteConfig'.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `blogPosts` collection includes an `authorId` field within each document. This denormalization avoids the need for complex queries or joins to determine the author of a blog post when enforcing write permissions.
